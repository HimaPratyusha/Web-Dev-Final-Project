To obtain a local copy of the current repository, use the git clone command followed by the repository's URL or clone it using the SSH. 
Using URL - git clone https://github.com/HimaPratyusha/Web-Dev-Final-Project.git

This will create a copy of the repository on your local machine, which you can use to modify or run the code. 
Alternatively, you can download the complete zip file of the project from the Github repository by clicking on the "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".
Once the zip file is downloaded, extract its contents to your local system and you can then access and run the files.
