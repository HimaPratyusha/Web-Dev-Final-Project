                higher education has always been one of my most cherished goals.
                I've been working towards it since I was young where I was
                interested in technology most of the time and it has helped me
                get to where I am now. Upon completing my undergraduate studies,
                I secured a position with Accenture Solutions, where I delved
                deep into the IT industry, gaining invaluable knowledge and
                experience for almost three years.My passion for technology and
                computer sciences began during my undergraduate years, which
                spurred me on to undertake numerous projects with great
                enthusiasm. With a keen interest in cloud computing, I am
                dedicated to sharpening my skills in this domain, with the aim
                of pursuing a fulfilling career in this field.
